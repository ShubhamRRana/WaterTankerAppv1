## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo (TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Local Storage (AsyncStorage)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6
- **Maps**: React Native Maps
- **Payment**: Cash on Delivery (COD) for MVP
- **UI Design**: iOS-style design system with consistent colors and spacing
- **Icons**: Expo Vector Icons (Ionicons)

## Key Features

### Customer Features
- Phone + password authentication
- Browse tanker sizes and prices
- Select delivery location on map
- View price estimate based on distance
- Book tanker with scheduled delivery
- Track order status in real-time
- View order history
- Save multiple delivery addresses

### Driver Features
- Phone + password authentication
- View available booking requests
- Accept/reject bookings
- Update order status
- View earnings and completed orders
- Toggle availability status

### Admin Features
- Tab-based navigation (Bookings, Drivers, Vehicles, Reports, Profile)
- **All Bookings Management**: View, filter, and manage all platform bookings
- **Driver Management**: Create, approve, suspend drivers with comprehensive profile management
- **Vehicle Management**: Add, edit, delete vehicles with insurance and capacity tracking
- **Customer Management**: View and manage customer accounts
- **Reports & Analytics**: View comprehensive platform statistics and analytics
- **Profile Management**: Admin profile editing with photo upload

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Install dependencies and start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Auth Flow (Multi-Role)

- Start at Role Entry screen to choose: Customer, Driver, or Admin.
- Login respects the chosen role when multiple accounts exist.
- Sign Up no longer asks for role; it uses the chosen role from Role Entry/Login.

## Environment Variables

For MVP, the app uses local storage (AsyncStorage) and doesn't require external API keys. However, for production enhancements, you may need:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_api_key  # Optional: For enhanced map features
```

**Note**: The app currently works without API keys as it uses:
- Local storage (AsyncStorage) for data persistence
- React Native Maps for map display (works without API key in development)
- Haversine formula for distance calculations (no API calls needed)

## Data Storage

The app uses AsyncStorage (local storage) with the following data structures:

- `users` - User accounts (customers, drivers, admins)
- `bookings` - Water tanker bookings
- `vehicles` - Vehicle/agency fleet management
- `tankerSizes` - Available tanker sizes and pricing
- `pricing` - Distance-based pricing configuration
- `driverApplications` - Driver registration requests
- `notifications` - In-app notifications

## MVP Scope

This MVP includes:
- âœ… All three user roles in single mobile app
- âœ… Phone + password authentication with multi-role support
- âœ… Scheduled bookings with date/time picker
- âœ… Cash on delivery payment
- âœ… Saved addresses for customers
- âœ… Order tracking with status updates
- âœ… Complete order history (current and past orders)
- âœ… Admin tab-based navigation with comprehensive management tools
- âœ… Driver management (create, approve, suspend, edit)
- âœ… Vehicle/agency fleet management
- âœ… Driver earnings tracking
- âœ… Distance-based pricing using Haversine formula
- âœ… Modern iOS-style UI with proper TypeScript support
- âœ… State management with Zustand stores (auth, bookings, users, vehicles)
- âœ… Profile management with photo upload for all roles

## Future Enhancements (v2)

- Online payment gateway integration
- Immediate/ASAP bookings
- Driver self-registration workflow
- Push notifications
- Ratings and reviews
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Google Distance Matrix API integration
- Automated driver assignment
