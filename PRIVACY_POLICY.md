## 2. Information We Collect

We collect only what is necessary to provide and improve the service.

### Personal information (required for account and bookings)

- **Email address** — for account creation and login  
- **Name** — for account identification and bookings  
- **Phone number** — for account creation, bookings, and contact by drivers  
- **Password** — stored in hashed form; we never store or see your plain-text password  

### Personal information (optional or role-specific)

- **Location (GPS)** — used only when you choose to set or use a delivery address, or for service-area features; you can deny permission and still use the app with a manual address  
- **Saved addresses** — delivery addresses you save, which may include approximate coordinates  
- **Business name** — only if you register or are set up as an admin  
- **Driver-related data** — if you use the app as a driver: vehicle number, licence details, and (if provided) emergency contact name and phone  

### Device and usage data

- **Device information** — such as device type and operating system, for compatibility and basic analytics  
- **Usage data** — in-app analytics (e.g. screen views, booking-related events) to improve the app; we do not sell this data  

We do **not** collect data from children under 13. The app is intended for general adult users.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Create and manage your account** (email, name, phone, password)  
- **Process and fulfil bookings** (delivery address, contact details, tanker size, date/time)  
- **Match you with drivers and show orders to drivers** (customer/driver name, phone, address as needed)  
- **Support payment handling** — currently Cash on Delivery (COD); if we add online payments (e.g. via payment gateways), we will use data only as needed for processing  
- **Send push notifications** (e.g. booking status updates), if you allow them  
- **Improve the app** — basic analytics (no sale of personal data)  
- **Comply with law** — when we are legally required to retain or disclose data  

---

## 4. Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** sell your personal data to third parties or ad networks.

We may share your information only in these cases:

- **Service providers** — with providers that help us run the app, under strict confidentiality (e.g. Supabase for backend and authentication; if we add payment gateways such as Razorpay or others, only as needed for payment processing)  
- **Drivers and operations** — customer name, phone, and delivery address are shared with the driver assigned to your booking so they can complete the delivery  
- **Legal requirements** — when required by law, court order, or government request  
- **Your consent** — where you have given explicit consent for a specific use  

Data is stored on secure servers (e.g. via Supabase); server regions may include EU/US or other regions depending on our hosting configuration.

---

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your data:

- **Authentication** — we use Supabase Auth; passwords are hashed and not stored in plain text  
- **Access control** — only authorised roles (e.g. drivers, admins) can access data needed for their function  
- **Secure transmission** — data is transmitted over HTTPS  
- **Storage** — personal and booking data is stored on secure cloud infrastructure  

No system is completely secure; we encourage you to use a strong password and keep your login details private.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

You have the right to:

- **Access** — request a copy of the personal data we hold about you  
- **Correction** — ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete data (e.g. via app profile or settings)  
- **Deletion** — request deletion of your account and associated data, subject to legal retention requirements  
- **Opt-out** — limit or opt out of optional data (e.g. disable location, or turn off push notifications in device settings)  
- **Withdraw consent** — where we rely on consent, you may withdraw it at any time  

To exercise these rights, use in-app settings where available, or contact us at [Insert your contact email]. We will respond within a reasonable time and in line with applicable law (e.g. 30 days under GDPR where it applies).

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy in the app and/or by email or in-app notice, and we will update the “Last updated” date at the top. Your continued use of the app after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
